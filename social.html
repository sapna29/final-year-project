            social institutions
            groups and relationships

This includes the physical features of the land. As well as the cultures that inhabit it and the political structures in place within a culture. To collect data, geographers study:
            maps satellite imagery photographs census responses fieldwork of their own

            establish new communities
            enlarge existing communities to adjust to population increases
            enhance outdated facilities
            First, urban and regional planners determine a communityâ€™s needs. They collect and assess information. To analyze their data, they use systems (GIS) to display data on electronic maps, as well as statistical software programs.</p>

    <h3>Survey Researcher </h3>
    <p>Many social science jobs rely at least in part on information gleaned through survey responses. However, a flawed survey will result in inaccurate data. Survey researchers specialize in creating quality surveys and interpreting the information that results. They begin crafting a survey by performing background research on the subject. Before going out, survey researchers test their surveys to make sure that subjects will understand their questions.
        Survey researchers work in:

academic institutions
nonprofit organizations
corporations
research firms
government agencies
polling organizations
